#dictionaries are used to store the data of the game
# # dictionaries are used to store data in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation. Dictionaries are created using curly braces {} and can contain items of different data types.
# # Dictionaries are unordered, meaning the items do not have a defined order and that order may change over time. Dictionaries allow duplicate values.
# # Dictionaries are indexed, meaning each item has a corresponding key, which is used to access the value. The keys must be unique and immutable (cannot be changed).
# # Dictionaries are iterable, meaning you can loop through the items in a dictionary using a for loop or other iteration methods.
