#type casting is the conversion of one data type to another by converting the data type to other i a typing the code in front of the 
x=1 
y=2.0
z="3"
#x is an integer, y is a float and z is a string



# print(x+int(y)) # this will add the two numbers and give the result as a float
# print(x+int(z)) # this will convert the string to an integer and add it to the integer x

# print(int(y)+int(z)) # this will convert the float to an integer and add it to the integer z

# print(float(x)+float(z)) # this will convert the integer to a float and add it to the string z
# print(float(y)+float(z)) # this will convert the float to a float and add it to the string z

print("the value of x is "+str(x)) # this will convert the integer to a string and add it to the string z
print("the value of y is "+str(y)) # this will convert the float to a string and add it to the string z
print("the value of z is "+str(z)) # this will convert the string to a string and add it to the string z

print(z*3)
