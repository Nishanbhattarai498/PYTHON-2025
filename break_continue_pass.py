#loop control statements
# break, continue, pass
# break statement
# The break statement is used to terminate the loop prematurely. When a break statement is encountered, the loop is exited immediately, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.
# The break statement can be used in both for and while loops.

# while True:
#     name=input("Enter your name: ")
#     if name !="":
#         print("Hello",name)
#         break

# phone_number = "123-456-7890"

# for i in phone_number:
#     if i == "-":
#         continue  # Skip the hyphen
#     print(i, end="")  # Print the digits without hyphens
# print()  # Print a newline after the loop

# for i in range(1,21):
#     if i==10:
#         pass #pass statement is used to do nothing, it is a null statement
#     else:
#         print(i,end=" ")
# print()# The pass statement is a null operation; it does nothing when executed. It is often used as a placeholder in situations where syntactically some code is required but no action is needed. For example, you might use pass in a function or loop that you plan to implement later.
